# GNU-Linux-CLI-manuals
## A list of PDF manuals for GNU utils, shell, AWK, etc.

Hello there! This is a simple repository with PDF manuals for several GNU/Linux programs and such. I have compiled the ones I find most important. There is also a file with links to where you can find more manuals. A lot of free software developers spend a lot of time and effort creating good and extensive documentation, so it is only fair we read it :)

Needless to say there are no Copyrighted works here _i.e._ no piracy. If you find any work that violates this principle, please tell me.

Have a great day! And happy readings.
