## Basic GNU/Linux programs

This folder contains manuals for "basic" programs, such as AWK, Sed, Grep, and GNU coreutils. It also contains scripting manuals for BASH, POSIX, _etc_.

I have made a separate directory for comprehensive books _i.e._ ones that have a lot of information on different toppics, such as "The linux command line", which teaches a little bit of everything. Even on Richard Stallman.
